# Genotypic_phenotypic_correlations
SAS Proc Mixed code to estimate genotypic and phenotypic correlations from plant breeding experiments

#EXAMPLE SAS PROGRAMS FOR ESTIMATING GENOTYPIC AND PHENOTYPIC CORRELATIONS AND THEIR STANDARD ERRORS
 
Example SAS codes correspond to J.B. Holland, "Estimating genotypic correlations and their standard errors using multivariate restricted maximum likelihood estimation in SAS Proc MIXED" 2006, Crop Science 46:642-654. 

All examples use data from Holland et al. (2002), Theor Appl Genet 105:113â€“126 available in an [excel spreadsheet](DataForCorrelationPrograms.xls).

Choose from four different examples for genotypic and phenotypic correlation estimation using REML:

1. [Correlations estimated from randomized complete block designs in multiple environments](REMLCorrMultiRCBD.sas). (Equivalent to code presented in manuscript).

2. [Correlations estimated from incomplete block designs in multiple environments](REMLCorrMultiLattice.sas).

3. [Correlations estimated from a randomized complete block design in one environment](REMLCorr1EnvRCBD.sas).

4. [Correlations estimated from an incomplete block design in one environment](REMLCorr1EnvLattice.sas).

[SAS programs for simulation study described in manuscript, to create simulation data sets, to randomly sample missing data, and to analyze data sets with MANOVA and REML]().
