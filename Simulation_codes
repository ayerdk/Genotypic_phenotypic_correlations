EXAMPLE SAS PROGRAMS USED FOR SIMULATION STUDY DESCRIBED IN HOLLAND, J.B. "Estimating genotypic and phenotypic correlations and their standard errors using multivariate restricted maximum likelihood estimation in SAS Proc MIXED"

SAS program used to generate full simulation data sets. 

(This program requires a folder with the following path: “C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Correlations\GDDHtBalancedDATA” to be created.  This is the folder where the simulation data sets will be stored).

 

SAS program used to analyze each balanced simulation data set with MANOVA (Proc GLM) and REML (Proc MIXED).

(This program requires two folders to be created:

"C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Correlations\GDDHtUnbalancedDATA\e2g75miss"

and "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Correlations\GDDHtUnbalancedDATA\e4g250miss"

These two folders will store the unbalanced simulation data sets).

 

SAS program used to make unbalanced data sets from full data sets. 

(This program requires a folder with the following path: "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Correlations\GDDHtBalancedOUT” to be created.  This is the folder where the parameter estimates from each analysis will be stored).
